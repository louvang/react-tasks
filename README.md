[React Tasks](https://louvang.github.io/react-tasks/) is a simple todo list made with [React](https://reactjs.org/). Todo list items are saved to the user's local storage so when the user refreshes the page, their todos will remain intact.

## Thoughts

This project was created primarily as a refresher to React. I meddled with React over a year ago, able to successfully make a few projects like a quote generator. Looking back, there were quote a few core concepts I didn't comprehend until now. I always understood that arrays in state were immutable (or should be treated as such) but what I couldn't wrap my brain around back then was just how every component and their 'attributes', so to say, connected with one another.

It's a lot clearer now and with my past few projects experimenting with Webpack, React makes so much more sense. I'm excited to pursue further activities using this JavaScript framework.
